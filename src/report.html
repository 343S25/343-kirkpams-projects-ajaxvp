        <h1>Report</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>The project is available <a href="https://github.com/343S25/343-kirkpams-projects-ajaxvp"
                target="_blank">here on GitHub.</a></li>
            <li>The website is available <a href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/peter2av/project/index.html"
                    target="_blank">here on w3stu.</a></li>
            <li>The website does not use media queries to create large and small layouts. These layouts are
                automatically implemented via the grid system available through Bootstrap.</li>
            <li>The website has four distinct pages: home, about, history, and settings. The content of the "Add
                Expense" modal is sufficient to support a fifth page, but it was made into a modal for ease of usage.
            </li>
            <li>The website has a header that is visible on every page.</li>
            <li>The website has navigation links in its header.</li>
            <li>The website has graphical material through the chart.js library. This material uses the &lt;canvas&gt;
                element, which does not support the 'alt' attribute. Instead, these elements have their 'role' set to
                'img'
                and have an 'aria-label' attribute describing their content. In addition, two images are used on the
                'About'
                page with adequate 'alt' descriptions appended.</li>
            <li>The website passes accessibility and validation checks.</li>
            <li>The website uses two font faces: IBM Plex Serif (regular content) and IBM Plex Mono (graphs)</li>
            <li>The website has a modal called "Add Expense," which functions as a form and uses form elements.</li>
            <li>The website links to my LinkedIn on the "About" page.</li>
            <li>The website renders content generated by the chart.js library. On the settings page, you can view a
                selection for different currency types to select as the default. This functionality is not yet
                implemented, but a fetch to <a href="https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api"
                    target="_blank">exchange-api</a> called is made to grab the list of currencies and then another is
                made to the same API to grab exchange rates to be used internally.</li>
        </ol>
